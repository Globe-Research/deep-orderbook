    \begin{abstract}
    Digital assets (cryptocurrencies) have a far more relaxed regulatory oversight than traditional financial instruments, which means that their orderbooks have a variety of complex phenomena that don’t occur in traditional markets. This is an investigation on how to build a deep learning model to forecast price action based on order books for cryptocurrencies.

    \section{Introduction}
    Digital assets (cryptocurrencies) have a far more relaxed regulatory oversight than traditional financial instruments, which means that their orderbooks have a variety of complex phenomena that don’t occur in traditional markets.
    This is an investigation on how to build a deep learning model to forecast price action based on order books for cryptocurrencies.
    Firstly implementing prior work, and investigating how to improve such models.


    Extension, determine features that are relevant and are the most important influencing factors for this model.
